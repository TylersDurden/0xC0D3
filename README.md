Announces memory location of python program variables 
in memory associated with itself (not sure what this will accomplish,
just curious). Next step will be to try and write changing data, and
watch for any patterns in end location. 

 If this can be determined, then 
try to read for various points a variable *was*, during the next 
recursive call. Will the same data still be there?
